# This is a comment
# Comments are used so that you can write notes
# Using the # symbol will tell python to ignore the rest of this line
print("Hello!") # this comment is for this line

# If you put the # between quotes, python will NOT ignore it
print("# this is not a comment")

# What else do you think comments might be good for?
